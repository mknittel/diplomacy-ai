About Castor:
Castor is a pure C++ header Library that introduces the Logic paradigm into C++. Castor integrates the Logic Paradigm using a few simple library primitives. This unique approach not only allows a natural and deep integration of declarative code into C++, but also provides the flexibility of combining Logic with other paradigms natively supported by C++ such as OOP, generics etc. STL concepts like iterators, containers and streams can also be used in declarative code.
